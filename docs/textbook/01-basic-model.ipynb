    "In the following example, we will create an SIR compartmental model for a general, unspecified emerging infectious disease spreading through a fully susceptible population. In this model there will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Three compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R)\n",
    "- A starting population of 1000 people, with 10 of them infected (and infectious)\n",
    "- An evaluation timespan from day zero to 20 units of time (we can think of these as days, but the time unit is arbitrary as far as the model is concerned)\n",
    "- Inter-compartmental flows for infection, deaths and recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a complete example of this model in action, and then examine the details of each step.\n",
    "This is the complete example model that we will be working with.\n",
    "As with any Python script, we first have to import the objects we need,\n",
    "plus we'll set the visualisation of pandas objects to be interactive."
