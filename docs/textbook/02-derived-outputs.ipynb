    "# Calculating derived outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous notebook](/textbook/01-basic-model.html), we saw how to create and run a simple compartmental model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on this to show how to request more detailed outputs from the model, in addition to just the compartment sizes. _summer_ supports the calculation of \"derived outputs\" - these are additional outputs that can be calculated from either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model compartment sizes for each timestep; or\n",
    "- The model flow rates at each timestep\n",
    "\n",
    "In epidemiology, we often want to estimate outputs from our models that are not just the absolute size of the individual explicitly modelled compartments or states.\n",
    "These quantities are not compartment sizes, but rather the absolute (not per capita) rate of transition between one state and another.\n",
    "Although such quantities may be part of the calculation that is used to update the population distribution from one time step to the next,\n",
    "these transition rates are not generally tracked during the numeric integration process.\n",
    "In epidemiology, one of the clearest examples of the need for this is the need to understand \"incident\" as well as \"prevalent\" quantities.\n",
    "Compartment sizes or the ratios of compartment sizes to the total population or to other quantities only provide us with information on the prevalence\n",
    "or relative prevalence of certain states within the overall population,\n",
    "and even these prevalent quantities may be more complicated than just the total number of people in a single compartment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend the range of outputs that can be estimated from a _summer_ model object, there are several different types of derived outputs that are supported:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Flow output](/api/model.html#summer.model.CompartmentalModel.request_output_for_flow)**: A sum of one or more flow rates at each timestep\n",
    "- **[Compartment output](/api/model.html#summer.model.CompartmentalModel.request_output_for_compartments)**: A sum of one or more compartment sizes at each timestep\n",
    "- **[Aggregate output](/api/model.html#summer.model.CompartmentalModel.request_aggregate_output)**: An aggregate of other derived outputs\n",
    "- **[Cumulative output](/api/model.html#summer.model.CompartmentalModel.request_cumulative_output)**: A cumulative sum of another derived output\n",
    "- **[Function output](/api/model.html#summer.model.CompartmentalModel.request_function_output)**: A pure function of other derived outputs\n",
