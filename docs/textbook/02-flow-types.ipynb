    "In the [previous notebook](https://github.com/monash-emu/summer/blob/master/docs/textbook/01-basic-model.ipynb), we introduced our general approach to creating and running a simple compartmental model of the transmission of an acute immunising infection. This basic model had only three compartments, which were linked together with two transition flows, with one additional flow through which the population simulated could exit the system (deaths). However, there are many epidemiological issues to consider when adding flows to the compartmental structure, and many different types of flow we might want to apply to our compartments.\n",
