This method defaults to using an [adaptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_step_size) [Runge-Kutta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods) solver, which tends to run the fastest out of the currently available deterministic options. There are two potential problems with using this solver:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **#1** The number of iterations required (and rumtime) can depend on the model dynamics. Changing the model can affect the runtime in unpredictable ways, because the step size can become very small.\n",
    "- **#2** The adaptive step size of this solver can completely miss transient events. For example, in the below plot, note how the day 14 import event was not picked up by the solver, because the system wasn't evaluated at the times necessary for this to have an effect. "

    "You can pass extra arguments to the solver function to adjust its behavior. For example, we can force the `solve_ivp` function to use a maximum step size of 0.1 so that it does not miss any transient import events ([docs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html)). By default, Summer uses a maximum step size of `1.0` for the default ODE solver (`solve_ivp`). The downside of using a smaller maximum step size is that the solver will need to evaluate the model at more timesteps and will run more slowly."
