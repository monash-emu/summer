    "# Running a model in stochastic mode\n",
    "\n",
    "[CompartmentalModel](/api/model.html) runs are deterministic, because the ODE solvers we use are deterministic. For a given set of compartments and (deterministic) flows, the outputs will always be the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "These deterministic models work better in scenarios where there is a large population and the law of large numbers has a strong effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, however, we want to simulate scenarios where some compartments have very low numbers of people. For example, we might consider a case where only 1-3 people are infected/infectious. The the deterministic ODE-based approach can produce absurd results such as \"half a person is infected\" and does not capture the underlying randomness of this scenario. To address this issue, there is a stochastic approach that can be used instead of the deterministic, ODE-based appproach. You can read the details of how it is calulated [here](https://autumn-files.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/Switching_to_stochastic_mode.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise the linked explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Flow rates are interpreted as probabilities\n",
    "- Transition and exit flows are sampled from a multinomial distribution\n",
    "- Entry flows are sampled from a Poisson distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this practically, you can run the model with `model.run_stochastic()` instead of `model.run()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "See below for an example. First, let's define a function to build our model:"
