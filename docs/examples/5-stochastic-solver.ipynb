    "Sometimes, however, we want to simulate scenarios where some compartments have very low numbers of people. For example, we might consider a case where only 1-3 people are infected/infectious. The the deterministic ODE-based approach can produce absurd results such as \"half a person is infected\" and does not capture the underlying randomness of this scenario. To address this issue, there is a stochastic approach that can be used instead of the deterministic, ODE-based appproach. In the stochastic model, flow rates are used to calculate entry/exit/transition probabilities, and the flow values are sampled from these probabilities at each timestep.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Calculating the flow rates, given the time and current compartment sizes, in the same manner as with an ODE-based model\n",
    "- Converting the flow rates into transition probabilities\n",
    "- Sampling from those probabilities to get the change in compartment sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, entry flows are treated differently to transition flows. To start, let's look at how entry flows are sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entry flows\n",
    "\n",
    "An entry flow is a flow that comes from outside of the system, such as a birth or a person entering the region from the outside. Entry flow rates are first calculated using the same approach as we would with the ODE solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example we might have a crude birth rate of 0.02 births/person/year and a population of 1e6 people, giving us 2e4 people born per year. This calculation is the same for both the deterministic (ODE) and stochastic solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the stochastic model we interpret this flow rate (2e4 people born per year) as the mean of a [Poisson distributon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution), which is used to sample the number of entering individuals. We use [np.random.poisson](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.poisson.html) in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a smaller timestep is chosen, eg. 0.1, or 1/10th of a year, then the mean number of arrivals is scaled down by a factor of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we sum up all the entry flow rates into a net flow. Eg. a birth flow of 2e4 people/year and an importation flow of 1e4 people/year into the same compartment will be summed into a net entry flow of 3e4 people/year. This net flow of 3e4 people/year is what is used as the mean of the Poisson distribution.\n",
