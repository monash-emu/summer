    "# Mixing matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "By default the Summer compartmental model assumes that everybody comes into contact with everybody else about the same amount (homogeneous mixing). This isn't always true. It may be the case, for example, that children tend to interact more with other children, and less with the elderly. This difference in social mixing can be expressed and modelled using a \"mixing matrix\". A NxN matrix which defines how each N strata of a stratification interact and may infect each other.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, in a 'child'/'adult' stratification, we could have the following mixing matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | child | adult |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| child | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n",
    "| adult | 0.5 | 0.5 |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mixing matrix, the columns are the infectors and the rows the infected. So the above matrix has following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "| | child | adult |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| child | child -> child | adult -> child |\n",
