    "# Strain stratification\n",
    "\n",
    "Summer provides a special disease-strain stratification class ([StrainStratification](http://summerepi.com/api/stratification.html#summer.stratification.StrainStratification)) that treats each strata as a separate disease strain. This will allow you to model multiple strains of a disease (or multiple diseases) which are able to infect people separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "They key difference between StrainStratification vs. a normal Stratification is that the strain stratification adjusts the count of infectious people per strain. For example, in a normal stratification with an age-based split into 'young' and 'old' you will have frequency-dependent infection flows calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find a common force of infection for both young and old\n",
    "num_infected = num_old_infected + num_young_infected\n",
    "force_of_infection = contact_rate * num_infected / num_pop\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use that common force of infection to get flow rates for young/old infection \n",
    "infect_rate_young = force_of_infection * num_young_susceptible\n",
    "infect_rate_old = force_of_infection * num_old_susceptible\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider now how this will be calculated for two strains (\"mild\" and \"wild\") when applied to an unstratified susceptible compartment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find a different force of infection for mild and wild\n",
    "force_of_infection_mild = contact_rate * num_infected_mild / num_pop\n",
    "force_of_infection_wild = contact_rate * num_infected_wild / num_pop\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the different force of infection values to get flow rates for mild/wild infection \n",
    "infect_rate_mild = force_of_infection_mild * num_susceptible\n",
    "infect_rate_wild = force_of_infection_wild * num_susceptible\n",
