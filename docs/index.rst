Summer documentation
==================================

Summer is a Python-based framework for the creation and execution of `compartmental models <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology>`_ (or "state-based") epidemiological models of infectious disease transmission.
It provides a range of structures for easily implementing compartmental models, including structure for some of the most common features added to basic compartmental frameworks, including:

- A variety of inter-compartmental flows
- Force of infection multipliers (frequency, density)
- Post-processing of compartment sizes into derived outputs
- Stratification of compartments

You can read more about the rationale behind Summer `here <http://summerepi.com/rationale.html>`_.
The source code for this library is available `on GitHub <https://github.com/monash-emu/summer>`_.
