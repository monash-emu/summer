# SUMMER
Scalable, Universal, Mathematical Model for Epidemic Reponses

## What is SUMMER?
SUMMER is a Python-based framework for the creation and execution of compartmental (or "state-based") epidemiological models of infectious diseases transmission.
It provides a range of structures for easily implementing compartmental models, including structure for some of the most commonly elaborations added to basic compartmental frameworks.

## Why SUMMER?
We saw a need for a more robust, easily extensible and universally accessible package for the construction of this sort of model.
In particular, SUMMER aims to be:
* More robust.
* Support the construction of considerably more complicated models, through a built-in stratification approach that ensures compartments and other features
